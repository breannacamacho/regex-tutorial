# Understanding the Structure of HTML Tags with Regex

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools in web development, often used to search, manipulate, and validate strings of text. One common use case is validating or extracting HTML tags within a string. In this tutorial, we'll explore a specific regex pattern that matches HTML tags, explaining each component of the expression and how it works to capture the structure of HTML.

## Summary

The regex we'll be examining is designed to match HTML tags, both self-closing and those with content between opening and closing tags. The pattern is:

/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are used to ensure that the pattern matches the start (`^`) and end (`$`) of the string.

Start Anchor (`^`): Ensures the match occurs at the beginning of the string.

End Anchor (`$`): Ensures the match occurs at the end of the string.

Example:
For the string `<div>Content</div>`, the anchors ensure that the entire string matches the pattern from start to finish.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group should be matched.

Asterisk (`*`): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.

Example:
In `([^<]+)*`, the `*` quantifier allows for matching zero or more characters that are not `<`.

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping is achieved using parentheses `()` to create capturing groups.

Parentheses (`()`): Group parts of the regex pattern to apply quantifiers or capture matched content.

Example:
In `([a-z]+)`, the parentheses capture the tag name like `div` or `span`.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, denoted by square brackets `[]`, specify a set of characters to match.e.

Square Brackets (`[]`): Match any one character from the set inside the brackets.

Example:
In `[a-z]`, it matches any lowercase letter from `a` to `z`.

### Character Classes
Character classes define sets of characters to match and can include predefined sets.

Backreference (`\1`): Matches the same text as the first capturing group.

Example:
In `<\/\1>`, the `\1` backreference ensures that the closing tag matches the opening tag captured by the first group.


### The OR Operator
The OR operator `|` allows for matching one pattern or another.

Pipe (`|`): Used to separate alternative patterns.

Example:
In `(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)`, the `|` separates matching a tag with content and a self-closing tag.

### Flags
Flags modify the behavior of the regex engine but are not used in this regex.

Example:
Flags like `i` for case-insensitive matching are not used in the HTML tag regex.

### Character Escapes
Character escapes are used to match special characters that have a specific meaning in regex.

Escape (`\`): Matches characters like spaces and forward slashes.

Example:
In `\/`, the `\/` escape matches a forward slash `/`.
